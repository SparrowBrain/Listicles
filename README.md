# Listicles
 Listicles Playnite plugin

This is a simple plugin that allows you to maintain and track lists of games.
It is best used in a large library when you want to have "Top 10" lists for example.
 
Install as any plugin:

Download the .pext file from the repository root and run it to install the plugin.

Features:

Create and maintain lists of games in your library.

You can re-order the games inside a Listicle as necessary, as well as the Listicles themselves.

Each Listicle can have its own URL, and there is a button in the top toolbar that will launch the selected Listicle's URL in your default browser (the selected Listicle is displayed in bold).

If a game is not in your library, you can add a "stub", which is just a placeholder entry. Stubs appear in italics in the list and have a default icon.

Notes:

My reason for creating this is to have an easy way to create "Top 10" and "Top 25" games lists from Youtube, and some gaming websites. I can add the games they cover to a Listicle as I watch the video or read the article. Later on, I am then able to open that video or article by clicking the Open Link button in the plugin toolbar in Playnite.

This can also be used to maintain a set of playlists for your games.
